# Complete DevOps Pipeline Implementation

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world DevOps workflow by designing, automating, and deploying a containerized Python web application. The project demonstrates the full DevOps lifecycleâ€”covering version control, infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and Ansible, containerization using Docker, orchestration on Kubernetes via AWS EKS, automated CI/CD with Jenkins, monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, and secure secrets management. The final output includes working infrastructure, pipeline execution, and comprehensive documentation.
## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Terraform**: To provision infrastructure on AWS (EKS, EC2, S3).
- **Ansible**: For automating the Jenkins setup.
