# Complete DevOps Pipeline Implementation

## 📚 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world DevOps workflow by designing, automating, and deploying a containerized Python web application. The project demonstrates the full DevOps lifecycle—covering version control, infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and Ansible, containerization using Docker, orchestration on Kubernetes via AWS EKS, automated CI/CD with Jenkins, monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, and secure secrets management. The final output includes working infrastructure, pipeline execution, and comprehensive documentation.
## 🖼️ Project Architecture Diagram

Before getting into the implementation details, here's a high-level diagram of the project's architecture. It illustrates the various components of the DevOps pipeline, from version control to infrastructure provisioning, containerization, CI/CD automation, deployment, and monitoring.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **AWS (EKS, EC2, S3, ECR)**
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure Provisioning)
- **Ansible** (Server Configuration)
- **Docker** (Containerization)
- **Kubernetes** (Orchestration)
- **Jenkins** (CI/CD Automation)
- **Prometheus and Grafana** (Monitoring)
- **GitHub** (Version Control)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Terraform**: To provision infrastructure on AWS (EKS, EC2, S3).
- **Ansible**: For automating the Jenkins setup.
- **AWS CLI**: For managing AWS resources from the command line.
- **kubectl**: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
  

## How to Set Up the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarabulella/Complete-DevOps-Pipeline-Implementation.git
cd Complete-DevOps-Pipeline-Implementation
```

## Step 2: Set Up AWS Credentials
Ensure your AWS credentials are configured to allow Terraform and AWS CLI to provision resources.
```bash
aws configure
```
## Step 3: Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

This project uses **Terraform** to provision the necessary infrastructure on AWS. The infrastructure includes:

- An **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** cluster with two nodes.
- A **CI/CD EC2 instance** (Virtual Machine) for Jenkins.
- An **S3 bucket** to store Terraform state files.

### 3.1: Set up Terraform Variables

Before running the Terraform script, ensure that you have set the required values for the variables. These values are used for AWS resource creation (like AWS region, instance types, and other configurations).

You can either define the variable values in a `terraform.tfvars` file or manually input them when prompted.

**Example of a `terraform.tfvars` file:**

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
region="us-east-2"
ec2_instance_type="t2.micro"
Eks_cluster_name="my-eks-cluster"
vpc_cidr="10.0.0.0/16"
ssh_key_name = "my-ssh-key"
ssh_key_path = "~/.ssh/my-key.pem"
s3_bucket_name = "my-terraform-state-bucket-konecta"
ami_id = "ami-04f167a56786e4b09"

```
### 3.2:  Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
This command initializes Terraform and installs the necessary provider plugins.
### 3.3:  Apply Terraform Configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the infrastructure creation. Type yes to proceed.
### 3.4: Ansible Playbook Trigger
Once the EC2 instance is provisioned, the Terraform script will automatically trigger a Bash script that checks the availability of the VM and then runs the Ansible playbook to configure Jenkins on the VM. This ensures that the Jenkins setup is automated without any manual intervention.

The Bash script (located in /scripts/config_cicd.sh) will:

Check if the EC2 instance is up and running.

Automatically apply the Ansible playbook to install and configure Jenkins.

You don't need to manually trigger this step—Terraform will handle it automatically after the infrastructure is provisioned.
## Step 4: SSH into the EC2 Instance and Deploy Kubernetes Resources

After successfully provisioning the infrastructure, I SSH into the **CI/CD EC2 instance** that was created using Terraform. This VM is configured to host **Jenkins** for automating the CI/CD pipeline. Here’s a breakdown of what I did next to set up and deploy the app.
### 4.1: SSH into the EC2 Instance

To begin configuring Jenkins and deploying my app to the Kubernetes cluster, I first needed to SSH into the EC2 instance. Here’s the command I used to access the instance:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
```
## Step 5: Set Up Jenkins for CI/CD
Once you’ve SSH'd into the EC2 instance and ensured Jenkins is installed, follow these steps to set up the Jenkins pipeline:
### 1. Install Required Jenkins Plugins:
### 2. Add Required  Credentials to Jenkins: Store the following credentials in Jenkins:
* REGION: 
* cluster-name: 
* image-name: 
* AWS_ACCOUNT_ID: 
* ECR_REPO:
### 3. Create a Multibranch Pipeline:
* In Jenkins, create a new Multibranch Pipeline and connect it to your GitHub repository.

* Jenkins will automatically detect branches (test and main) and trigger the pipeline accordingly.
### 3. Webhook Configuration:
* In your GitHub repository, create a webhook that triggers Jenkins on changes to the test or main branches.

* This will allow Jenkins to execute the pipeline when you push code to those branches.
## Step 6: Define the Jenkins Pipeline in Jenkinsfile
* Build and Push Docker Image: This will build the Docker image, tag it, and push it to the Amazon ECR repository.

* Configure AWS and Kubernetes Cluster: This will set up the AWS EKS cluster and apply Kubernetes configurations.

* Deploy to Test Environment: This will deploy the application to the test namespace in EKS if the pipeline is triggered from the test branch.

* Deploy to Production Environment: This will deploy the application to the prod namespace in EKS if the pipeline is triggered from the main branch.
## Step 7: Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

To monitor the performance and health of your application, we use **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for visualization.

### Grafana Dashboard Example:
Once the application is deployed, you can access the Grafana dashboard to monitor various metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and pod status. Here’s an example of what the Grafana dashboard may look like:

![Grafana Dashboard](/docs/cluster-dashboard.PNG)

This dashboard is set up to display the following metrics:
- **CPU Usage**: Displays real-time CPU consumption of the application pods.
- **Memory Usage**: Shows the memory usage of the application and Kubernetes cluster.
- **Pod Status**: A table displaying the health of deployed pods.
- **Request Rates**: A graph of incoming requests and response times for the application.

### Access Grafana:
- Grafana is exposed through a LoadBalancer service. To access it, navigate to the provided LoadBalancer IP address on port `3000` (default port for Grafana).
- The default credentials are:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `prom-operator` (Change this immediately after logging in)
## Step 8: Access Your Application

Once the pipeline is completed, your application will be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. You can access it through the LoadBalancer service by navigating to the provided public IP or domain.

**To access the application:**
- Open your browser and go to `http://<LoadBalancer-IP>`.
- The application should display a simple landing page or API response.
