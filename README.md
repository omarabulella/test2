Complete DevOps Pipeline Implementation
Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world DevOps workflow by designing, automating, and deploying a containerized Python web application. The project demonstrates the full DevOps lifecycleâ€”covering version control, infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and Ansible, containerization using Docker, orchestration on Kubernetes via AWS EKS, automated CI/CD with Jenkins, monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, and secure secrets management. The final output includes working infrastructure, pipeline execution, and comprehensive documentation.
